      If you're not attracting people visually, how will you get them to take
      the next steps to actually read (and, hopefully, subscribe to) your
      content? Once you're done creating quality content, you still have the
      challenge of presenting it in a way that clearly dictates what your blog
      is about. Images, text, and links need to be shown off just right â€”
      otherwise, readers might abandon your content, if it's not showcased in a
      way that's appealing, easy to follow, and generates more interest. That's
      why we've compiled some examples of blog homepages to get you on the right
      track to designing the perfect blog for your readers. Check 'em out,
      below.
