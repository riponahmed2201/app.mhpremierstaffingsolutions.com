                Being a professional Recruitment Consultant comes naturally to
                Manila. Experiencing her Grandfather's vineyard in childhood and
                developing a passion for Oenology, she further discovered her
                passion for fine dining while employed at various acknowledged
                Michelin establishments throughout Italy. A further opportunity
                would eventually bring Manilla to England where she helped
                develop a trademark Winebar/Restaurant and put it firmly on the
                map. With so much accomplished, she went on to successfully
                establish The Empire Bar and Restaurant including running
                theatre bars. Her varied experience and deep understanding of
                all aspects of the catering world have been honed by a life
                dedicated to the industry.
