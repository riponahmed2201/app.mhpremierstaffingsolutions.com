              <p className="about_us_section_paragraph">
                Founder and Owner of MH Premier Staffing Solutions and Mirko
                Hospitality Catering & Services, Mirko's story begins more than
                20 years ago, arriving in London like many Italians in search of
                a dream. <br />
                He began his career in restaurants in the lowest positions and
                quickly reached management roles in the most important Italian
                restaurants in London. <br />
                Choosing to work for the Illy Group expands his vision in
                contact with a structured multinational. <br />
                In the 2016 the big change that leads him to put his experience
                to good use in his own project is Mirko Hospitality Catering &
                Service, a company that follows private company events in
                London. <br />
                This experience allows him to develop and grow all the skills
                related to the recruitment processes of management and
                consultancy personnel in the world of Hospitality. <br />
                Today the new choice to make available his great experience in
                recruiting processes to companies and people looking for new
                challenges. <br />
                The large human component has always characterized his
                relationships with people and this still represents the center
                and basis of his choices today. <br />
                The choice of its staff comes from a vision and a human approach
                seeing in people those skills that a C.V. can't tell. His figure
                in the world of Italian restaurants in London is a well-known
                name and his proactive and positive approach to people has
                allowed him to generate solid connections based on trust and
                respect. <br />
                The MH PREMIER STAFFING SOLUTIONS project is just the beginning
                of a journey that wants to go beyond the borders of London and
                the United Kingdom. In one sentence, his vision is to make
                people's dreams come true as he made his own.

                Its history in the world of restaurants was born and
                consolidated in Italy. <br />
                There are various roles covered in prestigious and starred
                restaurants such as Restaurant Manager or supervisor. <br />
                His search for professional growth led him to London in 2018
                where he held the role of Restaurant Floor Manager at the
                BAGLIONI Luxury Hotel in London for more than 3 years. <br />
                The desire to start new experiences leads him to meet Mirko to
                put the great experience gained to good use. <br />
                Today his skills are available to MH PREMIER STAFFING SOLUTIONS
                Clients and as a recruiter he is able to evaluate profiles with
                a vision that is not born on the benches of a university but
                from managerial and operational experiences in medium-high level
                restaurants. <br />
                The characteristics that distinguish his profile are the great
                professionalism and the human component in the management of
                staff resources.

                Being a professional Recruitment Consultant comes naturally to
                Manila. Experiencing her Grandfather's vineyard in childhood and
                developing a passion for Oenology, she further discovered her
                passion for fine dining while employed at various acknowledged
                Michelin establishments throughout Italy. A further opportunity
                would eventually bring Manilla to England where she helped
                develop a trademark Winebar/Restaurant and put it firmly on the
                map. With so much accomplished, she went on to successfully
                establish The Empire Bar and Restaurant including running
                theatre bars. Her varied experience and deep understanding of
                all aspects of the catering world have been honed by a life
                dedicated to the industry.
