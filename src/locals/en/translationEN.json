  "why_should_i_consider_temporary_work_des": "Temping actually has many, many benefits! First and foremost, it's flexible; you can choose where and when you work. Often, you can start work quickly as temporary assignments are usually available immediately and paid fortnightly. It's also a great way to experience different environments, whilst gaining experience, building your network of contacts and having something positive to fill any employment gaps on your CV. You might even find that it's a route to a permanent role; we've lost count of the times we've placed a temporary worker into a short-term role and they've ended up being offered a role directly with the client. We must also point out that temporary work isn't for everyone, as the same flexibility which could be a benefit to some, might be outweighed by the need for a guaranteed, stable income to others. We'd certainly never recommend that anyone should leave a permanent role to take up a temporary assignment.",
